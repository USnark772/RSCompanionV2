- Using python's zipfile we can create/write/read a .rs item which is simply a zip file.
- Can we do this from multiple places or do we need to have a multiple producer/ single consumer type situation?
- How to save video files in this package?
    - Can only write to this zipfile from one place at a time (Must open/write/close before next writer can write)
    - Cameras would open/write/write/.../close which would block all other writers during an experiment.
- See Tests/zip_testing.py

- zipfile does not support writing to files in a zip. Files must be written completely before adding them to the zipfile
